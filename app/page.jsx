          ETEC provides access to our remote help desk software for enhanced customer support. 
          Our help desk allows the Customer to open a service ticket for any questions or issues 
          related to their Kamstrup solution at any time. Once a service ticket is created, our 
          entire support team is notified, and a team member will respond to answer questions or 
          provide assistance to resolve any issues related to Kamstrupâ€™s software, infrastructure, 
          or devices.
